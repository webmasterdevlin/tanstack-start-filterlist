An interactive, progressively enhanced (not fully) project task manager with filtering using TanStack Start with Tailwind CSS and Prisma. It's been purposely slowed down to showcase the handling of loading state.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Prisma Setup

You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

Consider adding a `.env` file to the root of the project and using these inside `schema.prisma` with `env("DATABASE_URL")`, refer to `.env.sample`.

After switching, delete the `prisma/migrations` folder before running the migration command.

When using sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```

When using sqlite, initialize with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```
